# Cat Catch

## A deep neural network for binary classification
### this code is an outcome of coursera "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" course by deeplearning.ai

## Setup
1. you will need a python 3 env to use this code
1. install all packages from deps.txt (pip install -r deps.txt)
1. put your images inside de image folder

## make a prediction
1. asign the variable "my_image" in "make_prediction.py" with the name of the image you want to be classified
1. run make_prediction.py
